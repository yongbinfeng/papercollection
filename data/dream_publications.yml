  summary: The first tests of a dual-readout fiber calorimeter in which silicon photomultipliers
    are used to sense the scintillation and Cherenkov light signals are described.
    The main challenge is minimizing optical crosstalk between the two fiber types,
    which carry light signals differing in intensity by about a factor of 60. The
    Cherenkov light yield was measured to be about twice that of previously tested
    PMT-based configurations. The lateral profiles of electromagnetic showers were
    measured on a millimeter scale and significant differences were found between
    the scintillating and Cherenkov fiber profiles.

  summary: In the past 20 years, dual-readout calorimetry has emerged as a technique
    for measuring the properties of high-energy hadrons and hadron jets that offers
    considerable advantages compared with instruments currently used at the high-energy
    frontier. The status of this experimental technique and the challenges faced for
    its further development are reviewed.

  summary: 'The root causes of the typically poor hadronic calorimeter performance
    compared to electromagnetic detection are investigated, and two remedies are evaluated:
    compensation and dual readout. The dual-readout approach is shown to be more promising,

  summary: Measurements of the response functions of a lead-based dual-readout fiber
    calorimeter (1350 kg) for pions, protons and jets with energies from 20 to 180

  summary: Particle identification in the longitudinally unsegmented RD52 dual-readout
    calorimeter is investigated using differences in scintillation and Cherenkov shower

  summary: The electromagnetic performance of the RD52 dual-readout fiber calorimeter

  summary: Matrices of BGO and PbWO4 crystals are studied as electromagnetic calorimeters
    with simultaneous scintillation and Cherenkov readout. The Cherenkov yield from
    BGO is sufficient for dual-readout calorimetry. Differences in the time structure
    of the two signal types are exploited to achieve event-by-event signal separation.

  summary: A systematic study of BGO and BSO crystals for dual-readout calorimetry
    is presented. BSO offers a considerably higher Cherenkov light yield; with a UV
    filter, the separation between Cherenkov and scintillation signals is substantially
    better in BSO than in BGO despite similar light attenuation characteristics.

  summary: It is shown that signals from the high-Z scintillating crystal BSO can
    be separated into scintillation and Cherenkov components by exploiting the polarization
    of the Cherenkov component. These studies were carried out in view of the possible
    application of such crystals in dual-readout calorimeters.

  summary: Lead tungstate crystals doped with various fractions of molybdenum are
    studied for dual-readout calorimetry. Doping increases the scintillation decay
    time and shifts the emission spectrum to longer wavelengths, improving Cherenkov/scintillation
    separation. Crystals with Mo concentrations of 0.1-1.0% are found suitable for
    dual-readout applications.

  summary: Up to 20% of the light from lead tungstate crystals results from Cherenkov
    rather than scintillation processes. A crystal electromagnetic calorimeter backed
    by the DREAM dual-readout calorimeter is used to determine these two contributions
    event by event, enabling elimination of the dominant hadronic fluctuation source
    and a significant improvement in calorimeter performance.

  summary: Neutron contributions to hadronic signals in the DREAM calorimeter are
    measured via the time structure of the signals. Neutrons from nuclear breakup
    contribute through elastic scattering off protons in scintillating fibers, producing
    an exponential tail with a ~25 ns time constant. The neutron contribution increases
    with distance from the shower axis and is absent from Cherenkov signals.

  summary: Detailed measurements of signals from high-energy electrons and muons in
    lead tungstate crystals reveal that a significant fraction is Cherenkov rather
    than scintillation light, as shown by the angular dependence and time structure
    of the signals. Depending on crystal orientation and particle type, Cherenkov
    light can account for up to 15% of the total signal.

  summary: Neutron contributions to hadronic signals in the DREAM calorimeter are
    measured by analyzing signal time structure. Neutrons from nuclear breakup scatter
